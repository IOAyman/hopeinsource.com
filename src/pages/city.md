title: '11: City as Liturgy'
date: '2019-03-21'
time: '54'
description: Is the city a toaster (an object) or a cat (a living organism)? We are joined by Dr. Timothy Patitsis to talk about how our physical and digital spaces, like liturgy, can be understood as "the work of the people". We discuss science as organized complexity, the meaning of knowledge, recursive societies, fractal hierarchies, and implications for governance.

## Show Notes (WIP)

- Nadia's [post](https://nadiaeghbal.com/public-life) on public life after reading Jane Jacob's book on cities
- ["The Death and Life of Great American Cities"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities) (Jane Jacobs)
- Timothy's post: "[The City as Liturgy](https://www.academia.edu/12035222/The_City_as_Liturgy_An_Orthodox_Theologian_Corresponds_with_Jane_Jacobs_About_a_Gentle_Reconciliation_of_Science_and_Religion)"
- ["After Writing: On the Liturgical Consummation of Philosophy"](https://www.amazon.com/After-Writing-Liturgical-Cosummation-Philosophy/dp/0631206728) (Catherine Pickstock). Linking liturgy/cities for Timothy. The author accused Descartes of substituting a "mode of knowing" that was impersonal, visual, timeless; similar to Jacobs' accusation of urban planners.
- Organic order isn't known all at once, is recursive/algorithmic (think of our relationships).
- We cope with perennial issues, like death, through liturgy (ritual).
- "[An Exploration of Hierarchy as Fractal in the Theology of Dionysios the Areopagite](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D832055Z)" - article from a friend that he recommends. Can't just throw away hierarchy entirely, but it can be fractal.

- ["The Cat and the Toaster: Living System Ministry in a Technological Age"](https://www.amazon.com/Cat-Toaster-Living-Ministry-Technological/dp/1608992705) (book)
    - Many references to the church as a body (1 Corinthians 12:12-31) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Christ), also reminded of being farmers/stewards/shepards.
- Timothy's upcoming new book: "The Ethics of Beauty"
