title: '11: City as Liturgy'
date: '2019-03-21'
time: '54'
description: Is the city a toaster (an object) or a cat (a living organism)? We are joined by Dr. Timothy Patitsis to talk about how our physical and digital spaces, like liturgy, can be understood as "the work of the people". We discuss science as organized complexity, the meaning of knowledge, recursive societies, fractal hierarchies, and implications for governance.

## Show Notes (WIP)

- ["The Death and Life of Great American Cities"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities) (Jane Jacobs)
- Timothy's paper: ["The City as Liturgy"](https://www.academia.edu/12035222/The_City_as_Liturgy_An_Orthodox_Theologian_Corresponds_with_Jane_Jacobs_About_a_Gentle_Reconciliation_of_Science_and_Religion)
- ["Reclaiming public life"](https://nadiaeghbal.com/public-life): Nadia's post after reading Jane Jacobs' book on cities
- ["After Writing: On the Liturgical Consummation of Philosophy"](https://www.amazon.com/After-Writing-Liturgical-Cosummation-Philosophy/dp/0631206728) (Catherine Pickstock). The article that linked liturgy with cities for Timothy. The author accused Descartes of substituting a "mode of knowing" that was impersonal, visual, timeless; similar to Jacobs' accusation of urban planners
- ["An Exploration of Hierarchy as Fractal in the Theology of Dionysios the Areopagite"](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D832055Z): Article about governance from a friend that Timothy recommends. Can't throw away hierarchy entirely, but it can be fractal
- [*Governing The Commons*](https://www.amazon.com/Governing-Commons-Evolution-Institutions-Collective/dp/0521405998) by Elinor Ostrom
- ["Governance without foundations"](https://nadiaeghbal.com/foundations): Nadia's post on foundations
- Organic order isn't known all at once, is recursive/algorithmic (think of our relationships)
- We cope with perennial issues, like death, through liturgy (ritual)
- ["Science and Complexity"](http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf) (Warren Weaver)
- [Desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path)
- [*The Cat and the Toaster: Living System Ministry in a Technological Age*](https://www.amazon.com/Cat-Toaster-Living-Ministry-Technological/dp/1608992705) (book)
    - Many references to the church as a body (1 Corinthians 12:12-31) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Christ), also reminded of being farmers/stewards/shepards.
- Timothy's upcoming new book: *The Ethics of Beauty*
- [Paperclip maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer)
